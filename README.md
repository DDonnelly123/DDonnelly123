# 👋 Hi, I'm Darragh Donnelly

I'm a **Software Systems student at Simon Fraser University** with a strong interest in **software engineering, systems programming, and game development**. I enjoy building things from the ground up, understanding how they work under the hood, and applying solid design principles to real projects.
